This directory holds the script to provide data to the amihacked website. It is
just that â€’ providing the data. The frontend lives elsewhere.

There are three script entry-points:
* export_repu: This is to be run on the archive.turris.cz machine. It generates
  exports of the whole history, in the form of several .csv.bz2 files.
* repu_init: This one fills the initial data into a database. It expects to be
  run in a directory with the .csv.bz2 files from the above script. The
  database must already exist and the home directory should contain a db.ini file.
* repu_add: This one adds data incrementaly, from files created by the
  archivist.pl. It expects the information to connect to the db in
  archivist.ini in the home directory.

The other scripts are helpers and are not to be called directly.
