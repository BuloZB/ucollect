The spoof plugin
================

The goal of this plugin is to check if ISPs properly block packets
with spoofed addresses (addresses not in their ranges).

Upon request, the plugin sends two packets to the server. One is with
the correct source address, the other is spoofed (the correct one is
to check reachability). The server than looks into the content of the
address and pairs it to the client, storing the result to database.

Currently, it works only on IPv4.

The request
-----------

The requests starts with the opcode `'4'` (character '4', not byte
with number 4). This is to provide possibility of future extension to
other types of requests.

Then there are these fields:

source address:: This is an `uint32_t` field, and it is the IP address
  that is set as source address on the spoofed packet.
destination address:: Similarly, an `uint32_t` field, meaning the
  address both packets are sent to.
port:: An `uint16_t` field, specifying the destination UDP port.
token:: An `uint64_t` token used for pairing packets to clients. It is
  randomly generated number.

The packet
----------

The packet is a UDP packet, with given port and addresses. It
contains:

Magic signature:: This is `uint32_t` number, always set to
  `0x17ACEE43`. This helps to verify the packet is ours and not
  something stray wandering the Internet.
Token:: An `uint64_t` number, copied verbatim from the request. It is
  used to pair the packet on the server side when received.
Spoofed:: A `bool` value, set to `true` on the packet that has spoofed
  address, `false` on the other one.
Message:: There's a character string explaining the packet is testing
  one. It has no meaning for the application itself, so it is ignored
  by the server.

Generation of packet
--------------------

The ordinary packet is sent first, the usual way (by opening a IP/UDP
socket and using `sendto`). The packet is then captured when going out
by WAN interface. The packet is examined and used as a template for
the forged packet. This saves a lot of sniffing through the OS to find
out needed information (like the MAC address of the gate, the correct
interface to send the packet through, etc). The source address is
modified according to the request and it is sent out though a
AF_PACKET socket.
