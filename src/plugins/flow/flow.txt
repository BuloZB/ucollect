The `flow` plugin
=================

This plugin gathers network flows and reports them to the server. A
flow is something like connection, however, we don't track SYN/FIN
packets. We just group packets with the same addresses and ports
together, count how much goes in each direction and send these items
to the server from time to time.

The server provides configuration (at startup and also when it is
updated), then client keeps track of when to send the data itself. It
sends either if too much time went by or when there's too many flows
to send.

There's also a filter that restricts which flows to capture. If it
doesn't match, the packet is completely ignored.

Protocol
--------

Messages are prefixed by single-byte opcode. As always, all numbers
are in network byte order. The server can send these messages:

`F`:: A force flush. Requests the client sends the flows right away,
  without any waiting. This is currently not sent by the server under
  any circumstance, but it may get used in future, for example in case
  of graceful shutdown.
`C`:: A configuration. It is followed by 4 32-bit integers, followed
  by representation of the filter (see below for the filter format).
  The integers represent:
  * Configuration ID (to check configuration equality).
  * Maximum number of flows to store before sending.
  * Maximum time of gathering before sending the flows, in
    milliseconds.
  * Minimum number of packets in a flow to be sent to the server.
    Smaller flows are omitted.

The client sends these messages:

`C`:: Client requests configuration.
`D`:: The flow data. The header contains client's current
  configuration ID (`uint32_t`) and current client's time (`uint64_t`,
  number of milliseconds since some unspecified time in the past ‒
  used as calibration of times mentioned in the flows). The rest of
  the message is filled with flows. See below for the format.

Filter format
-------------

The filter is a tree structure. Leafs match the packets directly (by
some parameter), while the inner nodes combine the results of their
children. The value in root specifies if the thing matches or not.

The data structure is serialized in preorder. Each type of node is
represented by a single byte and it is directly followed by its
parameters. In case of inner nodes, the parameters are the children.

The types are:

`T`:: Always true. There are no parameters. Usually used as an empty
  filter, to match all nodes.
`F`:: Always false. No parameters. It can be used to almost disable
  the flow plugin on the fly.
`!`:: Negation of its single child. The child directly follows after
  the `!` code.
`&`:: Logical and of all its children. It returns true if and only if
  none if its children returns false (from which follows that empty
  `&` acts like `T`). It doesn't evaluate all the children if one of
  them already returned false. The code is followed by an `uint32_t`,
  specifying the number of children. Then there's so many children
  encoded.
`|`:: Logical or of all its children. It returns true if and only if
  at least one children returns true. Its parameters are represented
  the same way as with `&`.
`i`:: Match local IP address ‒ it returns true if the local IP address
  of the packet is the same as one of its parameters. It is followed
  by single `uint32_t`, specifying the number of addresses. Then, each
  address starts with `uint8_t` ‒ its length (which is 4 for IPv4 or
  16 for IPv6) and then so many bytes of the address. The filter takes
  multiple addresses for performance reasons ‒ it is faster to specify
  the addresses as single `i` than build it from multiple `i` filters
  and `|`.
`I`:: Similar to `i`, but it matches on the remote address.
`p`:: Local port match ‒ it returns true if the local port of the
  packet matches one of the ones passed in its parameters. The code is
  followed by single `uint16_t` number, which is count of the ports.
  Then there's so many `uint16_t` numbers, each specifying single
  port (note that there can't possibly be more than 2^16^ different
  ports).
`P`:: Same as `p`, but with remote port.

There may be more filter types in future.

So, these representations are the same (the angular brackets enclose
number elements):

* `T`
* `!F`
* `|<0001>&<0000>`
* `|<0002>p<02><00><01>!p<02><00><01>`

Flow format
-----------

Each flow is represented on the wire as a sequence of items.

Flags (`uint8_t`):: This encodes the protocol and address family of
  the flow. If the address family is IPv4, the 0th bit is set to 0, in
  case of IPv6, it is 1. The 1st bit sets if it is TCP (0) or UDP (1).
Counts (2*`uint32_t`):: Count of packets in the inbound and outbound
  direction.
Sizes (2*`uint64_t`):: Number of bytes in the inbound and outbound
  directions.
Ports (2*`uint16_t`):: Local and remote port of the communication.
Time of first packet (2*`uint64_t`):: The time in which the first
  packet of the flow came, in inbound and outbound direction. It is
  the same representation as in the header of the `D` message from
  client. Specifically, it has the same epoch (which might be
  different for each client, so it needs to be correlated to the time
  on the server).
Time of the last packet (2*`uint64_t`):: The time in which the last
  packet of the flow came, in inbound and outbound direction.
Remote address (4 or 16 bytes):: The IP address of the remote end
  (local one is not included). The length depends on the address
  family in the first byte.

The flows are stuffed one after another into the message.
