 * There are two modes in which this may operate. A connected mode and unconnected one.
 *
 * In the connected mode, certain number of simultaneous connections can be accepted
 * (specifid by max_conn). A main FD is allocated in the beginning and set with
 * server_set_fd. Bunch of conn structures is allocated and whenever new connection
 * is accepted, the conn_set_fd is called on one of the conn structures with the new
 * fd. The server_ready is called on it every time data is available.
 *
 * In the unconnected mode, single conn structure is allocated, the main FD is set into
 * it and then the server_ready is called with it whenever it is readable. This mode
 * is enabled by setting max_conn to 0. The conn_set_fd callback is never used here.
 *
 * Note that even the main FD can change during the lifetime of the server.
 *
 * Only the server_ready is mandatory.
