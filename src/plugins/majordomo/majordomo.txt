The `majordomo` plugin
======================

`Majordomo` is the `lcollect` plugin for analysing flows of connected clients
in LAN.

Collected data are just small subset of hypothetical netflow. Eg. time
dimension is not considered.

Important notes to deployment
-----------------------------

There are 2 possible memory limits:

1) Maximum flows per client - this value is limited by SOURCE_SIZE_LIMIT
constant.

2) Maximum number of clients - this value is currently unlimited. Anyway,
expected production area is in SOHO routers with small number of real connected
clients. In this case aren't any limits needed.

For bigger networks is recommended to consider the introduction of the maximum
number of clients.
