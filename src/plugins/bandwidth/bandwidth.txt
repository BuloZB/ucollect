The `bandwidth` plugin
======================

Bandwidth is ucollect plugin for passive measurement of available bandwidth of
network connection.

Collected data
--------------

Bandwidth is trying to get count of bytes per second. Plugin uses multiple
'windows'. Each window has different length in microseconds. The final number is
count of bytes per window's length and the bps value must be computed.

Count and length of windows is configurable in source code.

The algorithm places every incoming packet into sliding window that slides at
time line. In fact, it is a group of sliding windows (of the same length) and
they are working together as buffer. In some point the sliding window falls out
from buffer and count of bytes per its length is taken as the candidate for
global maximum.

The main idea is that the global maximum should represent bandwidth of user's
internet connection. Different length of windows is just tool to evaluate the
stability of connection.

The protocol
------------

Communication protocol of bandwidth plugin is very simple. Server sends request
to dump data. The format of request is just one number - timestamp. Plugin (as
the response) generates 3 64-bit (uint64_t) numbers for every window length:

	1) Window length in microseconds
	2) Global maximum of download speed in bytes per 1)
	3) Global maximum of upload speed in bytes per 1)

Ucollect's binary protocol defines that the head of every message contains the
length of message in bytes. 64-bit number uses 8 bytes. Message length divided
by 8 is count of transmitted numbers. Count of transmitted numbers divided by 3
is the count of different windows defined in plugin.
