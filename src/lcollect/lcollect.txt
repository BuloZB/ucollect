The `ucollect` binary
=====================

The `lcollect` is libucollect implementation that is able to run locally -
without uplink. This behavior is useful when are provided some plugins that
don't send any data and process data only on client.


The configuration works in the same way as configuration of ucollect (see
ucollect documentation) with 2 exception:

	- lcollect configuration is stored in package lcollect
	  (/etc/config/lcollect), not in package ucollect(/etc/config/ucollect).

	- The configuration doesn't contains uplink section
