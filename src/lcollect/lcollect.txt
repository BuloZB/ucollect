The `lcollect` binary
=====================

The `lcollect` is alternative implementation of ucollect that is able to run
locally - without uplink. This behavior is useful for some plugins that process
data on client only.


The configuration works in the same way as configuration of ucollect (see
ucollect documentation) with 2 exception:

	- lcollect configuration is stored in package lcollect
	  (/etc/config/lcollect), not in package ucollect(/etc/config/ucollect).

	- The configuration doesn't contains the uplink section
