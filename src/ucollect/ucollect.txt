The `ucollect` binary
=====================

The `ucollect` is the actual binary that watches some network
interfaces and analyzes the packets by several plugins. It then sends
the gathered data to the central server for processing.

Invocation
----------

It takes exactly two parameters. The address (or DNS name) of the
server and a port where it listens (or textual name of service).

  ./bin/ucollect central.server.example.org 5678

Configuration
-------------

The configuration is read from `/etc/config/ucollect`. It uses the
http://wiki.openwrt.org/doc/uci[uci] system and syntax. An example
config would look like this:

  package 'ucollect'

  config interface 'eth0'
      option ifname 'eth0'
      list localaddr '127.0.0.1/32'
      list localaddr '192.0.2.1/24'
      list localaddr '::1/128'
      list localaddr '2001:db8::1/32'

  config plugin 'Count'
      option libname 'libplugin_count.so'

  config plugin 'Buckets'
      option libname 'libplugin_buckets.so'

The `package 'ucollect'` is always the same and should not be changed.
Then there are two kinds of sections.

The `interface` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This describes one interface to listen on. The option `ifname` specifies
the name of the interface on the system.

The `localaddr` list specifies address ranges to be considered on local
network. This is used by the plugins to decide if a given packet is
inbound or outbound.

The `plugin` section
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each such section describes one analysis plugin to load. The
(currently only) option, `libname`, specifies the file name of the
library to load as the plugin.
