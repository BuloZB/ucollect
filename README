Ucollect
========

Ucollect is small daemon for collecting and analyzing network data. It is
written in C (with some unusual conventions about memory allocation, see the
relevant documentation) and provides plugins for doing the actuall analyzes.

The repository also contains the server part (in srv/master) and various
support utilities.

To build, fist initiialize git submodules (`git submodule init && git submodule
update`) and then type `make`. You may need to supply some dependencies (guess
from possible compiler errors).

For further documentation, look into `docs` subdirectory (after you built it)
or into .txt files scattered in the source tree.
