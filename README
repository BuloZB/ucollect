Ucollect
========

Ucollect is small daemon for collecting and analyzing network data. It is
written in C (with some unusual conventions about memory allocation) and
provides plugins for doing the actuall analyzis.

The repository also contains the server port (in srv/master) and various
support utilities.

To build, type `make`. You may need to supply some dependencies (guess from
possible compiler errors).

For further documentation, look into `docs` subdirectory (after you built it)
or into .txt files scattered in the source tree.
